# Detail Loss in Super-Resolution Models Based on the Laplacian Pyramid and Repeated Upscaling and Downscaling Process

This is a repository for our paper: 

Sangjun Han and Youngmi Hur, "Detail Loss in Super-Resolution Models Based on the Laplacian Pyramid and Repeated Upscaling and Downscaling Process"

We are organizing our code to make it easier to read.

TODO:
~~First commit code in cnn dir~~  
First commit code in attention dir  
Upload trained model parameters used in our experiments  
Describe our code in README  
Integrate all codes to run with minimal execution commands (config)
