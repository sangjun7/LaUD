# Detail Loss in Super-Resolution Models Based on the Laplacian Pyramid and Repeated Upscaling and Downscaling Process

This is a repository for our paper:  

Sangjun Han and Youngmi Hur, "Detail Loss in Super-Resolution Models Based on the Laplacian Pyramid and Repeated Upscaling and Downscaling Process"  

You can download our trained model parameters from Google Drive.

We are currently organizing our README to help you implement our code.

TODO:  
~~First commit code in cnn dir~~  
~~First commit code in attention dir~~  
~~Upload trained model parameters used in our experiments~~  
Describe our code in README  
Integrate all codes to run with minimal execution commands (config)
